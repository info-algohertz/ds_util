# ds_util
Utility functions for **data science** in Rust for easy data analysis.

The aim of this project is to enable Rust developers work with data in a simple way directly through basic structures in Rust such as vectors and floats.
Writing efficient code in basic Rust directly is easy. This project favours workflow in which a developer does not need to remember and understand complex changing possibilities, but can write good code by understanding the unalterable fundamentals of computer science and mathematics, and stable basic functionalities of Rust programming language.
